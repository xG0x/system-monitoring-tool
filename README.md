Project: Automated System Monitoring Tool

Description: The Automated System Monitoring Tool is a Python-based application that helps monitor essential system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. This tool runs periodically and automatically sends a detailed report via email to the specified recipient. It uses the psutil library to collect system data and the yagmail library to send emails securely. The tool is designed to run in the background, allowing users to keep track of their system’s health with minimal intervention.

The tool is useful for:

    System administrators who need to keep track of multiple machines.
    Home users who want to ensure their system is running smoothly.
    IT professionals who need to quickly assess system performance.

The tool can be easily modified to add more metrics (such as network usage, uptime, etc.) and to send reports in different formats (e.g., HTML, PDF).

Features:

    CPU Monitoring: Continuously tracks CPU usage and provides the percentage of CPU currently being used.
    Memory Usage Monitoring: Tracks memory (RAM) usage and alerts if it exceeds predefined limits.
    Disk Space Monitoring: Monitors disk usage and provides information about available disk space.
    Automated Reports: Sends an email every 10 minutes with the latest system metrics.
    Customizable Email Alerts: Allows you to customize the recipient email address and the subject line of the report.
    Running in the Background: Can be run as a background process on Linux systems (using cron or nohup).
    Secure Email Integration: Uses Gmail's App Password feature to send reports securely, with two-factor authentication enabled.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    psutil library (to gather system metrics)
    yagmail library (to send emails securely through Gmail)
    Gmail account (with 2FA enabled and an app-specific password)

How it Works:

    The tool collects system data (CPU, memory, and disk usage) using psutil.
    It generates a text-based report with this information.
    The report is automatically sent via email using yagmail.
    The tool is set to run in the background, sending periodic reports (every 10 minutes).
    The email is sent using a Gmail account configured with App Passwords for added security.

Installation and Usage:

    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-monitoring-tool.git
    
Install required Python libraries:

    pip install psutil yagmail
  
Set up your Gmail account with 2FA and create an App Password.

Modify the script system_monitor.py to use your Gmail credentials and recipient email.

Run the script:

    python system_monitor.py
    
Future Enhancements:

    Additional metrics like network usage, battery status, etc.
    Email format options (HTML, PDF reports).
    Dashboard to visualize the metrics in real-time (via web interface).
    Alert thresholds for CPU, memory, and disk usage, sending alerts only when limits are exceeded.
